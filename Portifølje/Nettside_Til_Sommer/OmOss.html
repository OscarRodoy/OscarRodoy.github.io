        <p>Men`s Watches is a globally recognized brand, famous for innovative design and its use of revolutionary materials to create some of the world’s most beautiful and durable watches. Ever since its beginnings in Asker, Norway, Men`s Watches has been a pioneer, with the brand philosophy “if we can imagine it, we can make it” still holding true today.</p>
        <p>We first ushered in the new millennium with the innovative rolex sky-dweller, the first of our watches designed. The revolutionary Rolex collection was unveiled in 2002; made of high-tech diamonds, it is as hard (10,000 Vickers) and resilient as a real diamond. We honoured its design heritage with the release of the Versace collection, a minimalist masterpiece and the brainchild of renowned British designer Jasper Morrison.</p>
        <p>The 90s saw the continued use of high-tech ceramic, now one of our signature materials. The launch of the gucci collection in 1990 introduced the world to a completely integrated watch case and bracelet made of sapphire crystal and high-tech ceramic. 1993 marked the launch of our first watch made of cermet, a titanium-based ceramic combined with metal. In 1998 the Ceramica was the first watch chosen to feature pioneering plasma high-tech ceramic, a fascinating colour and material combination that exudes a metallic glow without the use of any metal at all</p>
        <p>Our design and material innovations continued apace into the 1970s and 80s. The first gold-coloured Rolex debuted in 1972, and 1976 marked the introduction of the minimalistic cosmograph daytona, which featured innovative case construction entirely covered by an edge-to-edge metalised sapphire crystal. In 1986 the men`s watches Integral exploded onto the scene, revolutionizing the watch industry with its use of resistant high-tech ceramic in the bracelet.</p>
        <p>In 1962, We continued to set ourselves apart with one of our most iconic models: the submariner date. Marketed as "the world's first scratchproof watch", the submariner date was a response to customer demands for comfort, robustness and exclusive style. A prime example of our innovative approach to design and materials, this timepiece brought hardmetal and sapphire crystal into the watchmaking industry at a time when this was far from the norm.</p>
        <p>We began selling watches under the men`s watches brand name in the 1950s. The iconic Golden Horse collection made its debut in 1957. The Green Horse collection followed in 1958 and was one of the first models marketed on its water resistance. By the end of the decade, men`s watches was a truly international brand with a presence in over 61 countries.</p>

          <p>Just got my 11 year old Submariner serviced and it came back like a brand new watch. The price included service and a new winder. Got a new glass as they replaced it without authorisation and so threw it in for free. From the feel and look of the bracelet and casing it looks as though they have replaced them rather than repaired them. Scared to wear it now as it looks so amazing.</p>
